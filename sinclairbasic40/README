Sinclair-Basic V4.0


A basic interpreter improvment for the Spectrum 16/48.

To load the program (basic40.tzx) type:
CLEAR 58999
LOAD "" CODE
RANDOMIZE USR 60000

After a NEW the interpreter must be started with 
RAND USR 60000 again.

The source (a-sinclairbasic40.tzx) can be loaded 
with EDITAS48.

G-TOOL.TZX is a small drawing program and
SYSTEM.TZX displays some system variables.
Both programs need SinclairBasic 4.0 tu run.

Command list:

*A x,y,r     CIRCLE       fast circle (about 50 times faster)
*B x,y;w,h   BOX          draws a box
*C           COPY         192 lines COPY
*D x,y       DRAW         draws a line to x,y
*E r,z;x,y   ELIPSE       draws an elipse at pos(x,y), radius(r) 
                          z=10 is a circle, z<>10 an elipse
*F x,y       FILL         fills a polygon
*G x                      disables (x=0) or enables (x=1) error messages
                          errors will be ignored when disabled, the program
                          can only stopped with GOTO10000 or *G1:STOP
*K                        calls the internal copy program
*L x,y       HL-LOAD      Headerless-LOAD (address x, length y)
*ML x        MOVELEFT     scrolls the screen
*MR x        MOVERIGHT      "
*MU x        MOVEUP         "
*MD x        MOVEDOWN       "
*N           NUMBER       number protection, replaces all numbers with "."
*P x,y       DPOKE        16-Bit POKE
*R           RESET        clears the complete memory
*S x,y       HL-SAVE      Headerless-SAVE (address x, length y)
*TU x,y,z    TRANSFERUP   transfers a block from x to y with length z (x++,y++,z--)
*TD x,y,z    TRANSFERDOWN transfers a block from x to y with length z (x--,y--,z--)
*U x         UDG bank     switches to UDG bank x (0=normal bank, 1-4)
                          a bank will be saved with "*U2:SAVE "name" CODE USR "a",168"
*VI x,y                   searches for INK x and replaces it with INK y
*VP x,y                    like above but PAPER
*VCI x                    sets forgroundcolor to x
*VCP x                    sets backgroundcolor to x
*VDU i,p,f,b              sets INK,PAPER,FLASH,BRIGHT (screen will not be cleared)
*W x$        WAITKEY      waits for key x$
*W x         WAITKEYCODE  waits for key with code x
*X           CLS          nice CLS
*Z                        should be used before making a hardcopy on a dot-matrix printer
